      <p>
         Most policies will automatically renew on their renewal date (we'll confirm this with you once you've bought your policy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your renewal quote will be available at least three weeks before your renewal is due, to give you time to decide if you want to stay with us. If your price and details are ok, you won’t have to do anything. After renewing, you have a two week cooling-off period where you won't be charged a cancellation fee if you change your mind. All you'll be asked to pay for is the amount of time you were insured for, plus a renewal arrangement fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can opt out of automatic renewal at any time online or over the phone. However, if you're in the last month of your policy, you'll need to call us to opt out. You may find your renewal price is higher than the price of your policy today.
      </p>

      />
      <p>
        If you cancel before your start date, you’ll get a full refund of your premium, minus any non-refundable fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a 14 day cooling-off period from your policy start date. Cancelling during this time means your premium will be refunded, minus a charge for the number of days you were insured by us and any non-refundable fees. The same applies if your policy is cancelled after the cooling-off period but you’ll also be charged a cancellation fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’ve made a claim (or one’s been made against you) you might not get a refund.

      <p>
        We’re an intermediary, acting on behalf of several insurers. We don’t make recommendations or give advice, so please consider all information carefully when you buy to make sure the product/s offered meet your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We receive commission paid by the insurer and a fee paid by you.  The total price you'll pay is made up of the insurer's premium plus our fee, together with Insurance Premium Tax (IPT) at the current rate.

            When you buy your policy, you're agreeing to let us use your card details (or any new card details you give us) for future payments to do with your policy. This includes paying for things like missed Direct Debit instalments, changes to your policy that increase your premium or your renewal.
